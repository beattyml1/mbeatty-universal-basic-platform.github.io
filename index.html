		<h2>Universal Basic Health Care</h2>
		<h3>Publicly funded, privately administered. Universal coverage, individual choice</h3>
		<p>Health care will be funded through progressive federal taxes. Everyone will get a flat amount to put towards the plan of their choice. Those that don't elect a plan will be auto-enrolled in a plan chosen by their State. States will be expected to use the full allowance which should be enough cover a solid basic plan but there is nothing stopping them from adding additional funding a more premium plan from their own budget.</p>
		<h3>Health care Transparency</h3>
		<p>Health care provideres will be required to make their prices transparent and we will make sure they have the tools to do this well.</p>
		<h3>All the little things</h3>

All student loans will have the terms that keep the loans from be wiped out in bankruptcy removed.</p>
